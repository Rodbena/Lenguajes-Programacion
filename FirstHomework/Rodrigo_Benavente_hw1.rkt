(define (is-triangle a b c);We recieve three sides
  (cond
    [(or (<= a 0) (<= b 0) (<= c 0) ) #f];We check if at least one lenght is less or equal to 0
    [(and
      (> (+ a b) c);first condition
      (> (+ b c) a);second condition
      (> (+ c a) b);third condition
      ) #t];We check all the other conditions to see if it's a triangle
    [else #f]
   )
);end of my first exercise

(define (triangle-type a b c);second exercise, we recieve three sides
  (cond ;This condition helps me check if the sides belong to a triangle
    [(is-triangle a b c);Runs function to check if it's a triangle
     (cond
       [(= a b c)'EQUILATERAL];Checks if it's an equilateral triangle
       [(or (= a b) (= b c) (= c a)) 'ISOSCELES];Checks if it's an isosceles triangle
       [else 'SCALENE];Checks if it's a scalene triangle

    ]
    [else 'INVALID];Sides don't belong to a triangle

(define (point-quadrant x y);Third exercise, we recieve the coordinates of a point in 2d
    (if (and (> x 0) (> y 0)); Checks if x and y belong to the first quadrant 
        'I
        (if (and (< x 0) (> y 0));Checks if x and y are in the second quadrant
        'II

         'IV
         (if (and (> x 0) (= y 0));Checks if x and y are in the x axis
          'X_AXIS

(define (parking-ticket hours minutes status);Fourth exercise, we recieve #hours #mins and the status of the ticket
  (cond ;Cond to check the status of the ticket
