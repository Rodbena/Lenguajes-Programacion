(define (get-pi-regular num);First exercise, recieves the terms to compute the value of pi
    (if (zero? num) 0;If the number is 0 the recursion stops and we return the total, else we start calculating pi
         (+ ;Add the result of every iteration
          (/ (* (expt -1 (+ num 1)) 4) (- (* 2 num) 1.0)) (get-pi-regular (sub1 num)));We start calulating pi and we start a recursion to get a more accurate answer
    );end of if
 );End of my first exercise

(define (get-pi num);Second exercise, recieves the terms to compute the value of pi
  (let loop;Start an anonymous function that will help with tail recursion
    ([i num] [total 0]);Create variables and assign them initial values
    (if (zero? i);Check to see if the number is 0
        total;If number is 0 we return total, else we calculate pi
        (loop (sub1 i) (+ (/ (* (expt -1 (+ i 1)) 4) (- (* 2 i) 1.0)) total));We start calulating pi and we start a tail recursion to get a more accurate answer
    );end of if
    );End of anonymous function
  );End of my second exercise


(define (ln-2 num);Third exercise, recieves a number to compute the value of the natural logarithm of 2
  (let loop;Anonymous function that helps with tail recursion
    ([i num] [total 0]);Create variables and assign them initial values
    (if (zero? i);Check to see if the number is 0
        total;If number is 0 we return total, else we calculate ln of 2
        (loop (sub1 i) (+ (/ 1 (* (* 2 i) (- (* 2 i) 1.0))) total));We calculate ln2 and start tail recursion
     );end of if
    );End of anonymous function
  );End of my third exercise

(define (russian-*-regular num1 num2);Fourth exercise, recieves two numbers to multiply
  (if (or (zero? num2) (zero? num1)) 0;Ends recursion and returns total
      (if (even? num2);Checks if the number is even
          (+ (russian-*-regular (* num1 2) (quotient num2 2)) 0);Add nothing to the total, multiply num1*2, and start recursion
          (+  (russian-*-regular (* num1 2) (quotient num2 2)) num1);Add "num1" to the total,, multiply num1*2, and start recursion
      );End of if that checks for even numbers
  );End of if that checks if the quotient of num2 is 0
 );End of my fourth exercise

(define (russian-* num1 num2);Fourth exercise, recieves two numbers to multiply
  (let loop;Anonymous function that helps with tail recursion
    ([a num1] [b num2] [total 0]);Create variables and assign them initial values
    (if (or (zero? b) (zero? a)) total;Ends recursion and returns total
        (if (even? b);Checks if the number is even
            (loop  (* a 2) (quotient b 2) total);Add nothing to the total, multiply a*2, and start recursion
            (loop   (* a 2) (quotient b 2) (+ total a));Add "a" to the total, multiply a*2, and start recursion
          );End of if that checks for even numbers
     );End of if that checks if the quotient of num2 is 0
   );End of anonymous function
 );End of my fourth exercise
